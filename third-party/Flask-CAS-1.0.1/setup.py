            Flask-CAS
            =========

            Flask-CAS is a Flask extension which makes it easy to
            authenticate with a CAS.

            CAS
            ===

            The Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a single sign-on 
            protocol for the web. Its purpose is to permit a user to access 
            multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as 
            userid and password) only once. It also allows web applications 
            to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's security 
            credentials, such as a password. The name CAS also refers to a 
            software package that implements this protocol. 

            (Very short) Setup Tutorial
            ===========================

            First create a Flask instance:

            .. code:: python

                from flask import Flask

                app = Flask(__name__)

            Apply CAS on your Flask instance:

            .. code:: python

                from flask.ext.cas import CAS

                CAS(app)

            Do needed configuration:

            .. code:: python

                app.config['CAS_SERVER'] = 'https://sso.pdx.edu' 

                app.config['CAS_AFTER_LOGIN'] = 'route_root'

            Using
            =====

            After you setup you will get two new routes `/login/`
            and `/logout/`.
